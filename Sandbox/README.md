# Sandbox

This is for work-in-progress code.

This should mimic the production folder but contain code that is not fully ready.

Once code is ready for production:

1. Create a PR to merge your code into dev.
2. Once in dev, move from sandbox to production folder.
3. Create a release branch and PR to merge into main.
4. Git tag the new release.
